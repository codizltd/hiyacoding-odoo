          `_get_to_invoice_qty()` for more information on how this quantity is calculated.
        - upselling: this is possible only for a product invoiced on ordered quantities for which
          we delivered more than expected. The could arise if, for example, a project took more
          time than expected but we decided not to invoice the extra cost to the client. This
          occurs onyl in state 'sale', so that when a SO is set to done, the upselling opportunity
